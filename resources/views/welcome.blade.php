                              <p>The Dhammachai International Research Institute (DIRI) Manuscript Project aims to make ancient Buddhist manuscripts available to be viewed online for the first time.</p>
                              <p>Some of these manuscripts are over 2,000 years old. Many are written in an ancient Indian language called Pali, which is related to Sanskrit. However, there is no standard script for Pali, so these manuscripts are written in a variety of scripts, including Gandhari, Thai and Khmer.</p>
                              <p>The Dhammachai International Research Institute of New Zealand and Australia has been conducting a number of activities in the fields of education and research in Buddhist Studies.</p>
